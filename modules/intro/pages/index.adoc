TigerGraph CoPilot is a natural language query service that allows users to ask questions about their graph data in plain English.
This service uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to convert the user's question into a function call, which is then executed on the graph database.

[CAUTION]
====
TigerGraph CoPilot is still in beta release and the documentation is in progress.

[IMPORTANT]

TigerGraph CoPilot beta is  for personal or R&D use and not for production use.

3/18/2024: CoPilot is available now in Alpha (v0.0.1).
It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to convert your question into a function call, which is then executed on the graph in TigerGraph.
We would love to hear your feedback to keep improving it so that it could bring more value to you.
If you are trying it out, it would be helpful if you could fill out this sign up form so we can keep track of it (no spam, promised).
And if you would just like to provide the feedback, please feel free to fill out this short survey after you have played with CoPilot.

Thank you for your interest and support!
