= CoPilot Overview

TigerGraph CoPilot combines two of the most powerful technologies for extracting value from a knowledge base — LLMs and graph databases.
This combination delivers superior AI performance — more accuracy and greater contextual relevance.

.It features:
* *Natural Language Inquiry*: The product’s natural-language and auto-execution capabilities empower non-technical users to focus on mining insights from their data through an AI assistant that they can “talk” to.
Rather than having to learn a new technology or language when a question is posed in natural language, TigerGraph CoPilot determines the best available query needed to answer that question, runs the query, and returns the results in natural language, graph visualizations and other ways a user can more clearly understand.

* *Graph-Augmented Generative AI*: TigerGraph CoPilot creates chatbots with augmented AI on a user’s own documents.
The tool builds a knowledge graph from source material and applies knowledge graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to improve the contextual relevance and accuracy of answers to their natural-language questions.

* *Reliable and Responsible AI*: TigerGraph CoPilot mitigates AI hallucination by allowing LLMs to access the graph database via curated queries.
It also adheres to the same role-based access control and security measures (already part of the TigerGraph database) to assure responsible AI.
TigerGraph CoPilot also enables transparency by open-sourcing its major components and allowing users to choose their LLM service.

* *High Scalability and Performance*: By leveraging the TigerGraph database — the most scalable and performant platform for connected data — TigerGraph CoPilot runs graph analytics and obtains insights from a graph much faster than other LLM-graph solutions.
As a graph-RAG solution, it is able to utilize knowledge bases at a much larger scale than other knowledge graph-powered Q&A solutions.
