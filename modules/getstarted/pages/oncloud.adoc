If you haven’t added any LLM provider previously, please click on the link of btn:[ Click here to add ], which will take you to a new window to add your LLM providers.


Once it is done, please continue to finish creating the workspace. (See xref:master@cloudBeta:resource-manager:workspaces/how2-create-a-workspace.adoc[] for more details).


== 3) Load Data

After the workspace is created, TigerGraph CoPilot will be ready as well, but there isn’t much to do until there is data in your database.

So please go ahead and load your data into the database following the instructions  at xref:master@cloudBeta:load-data:index.adoc[]
or add a xref:master@cloudBeta:integrations:solutions.adoc[solution kit] to your database, if you have not already.

== Next Steps

And then come back to xref:tg-copilot:using-copilot:how2-use-on-cloud.adoc[] to learn how to use CoPilot.
