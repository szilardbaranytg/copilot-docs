= How to access CoPilot vis its API
:experimental:

After authentication you can access TigerGraph CoPilot via its API for both self-managed and TigerGraph Cloud managed services.

.Two types of API access are provided:
* REST HTTP endpoints
* pyTigerGraph

include::partial$authentication.adoc[]

== REST HTTP Endpoints
For self-managed services, the full list of available HTTP endpoints can be found at the `/docs` path on your host’s address, e.g., http://localhost:8000/docs.

It is a Swagger API doc, and you can even try out the endpoints on that page.

[NOTE]
====
The Swagger API doc page is disabled on TigerGraph Cloud.
====

////
Below we list several key endpoints which should satisfy most use cases.

== pyTigerGraph

[NOTE]
====
This guide assumes you are already familiar with pyTigerGraph.
If not, see our documentation xref:1.6@pytigergraph:getting-started:index.adoc[] with pyTigerGraph.
====

1. First, make sure you have the latest version of pyTigerGraph as it is under active development for the CoPilot functions.
+
[source, python]
----
pip install -U pyTigerGraph
----
+
//pip install -U git+https://github.com/tigergraph/pyTigerGraph.git

2. Next, configure the endpoints with a `TigerGraphConnection`. As in this example code snippets below:
+
.Import `TigerGraphConnection`:
[source, python]
----
from pyTigerGraph import TigerGraphConnection
----
+
.Create a connection to the database.
[source, python]
----
conn = TigerGraphConnection(host="DATABASE_HOST_HERE", graphname="GRAPH_NAME_HERE", username="USERNAME_HERE", password="PASSWORD_HERE")
----
+
.Configure CoPilot host:
[source, python]
----
conn.ai.configureCoPilotHost("COPILOT_HOST_HERE")
----
+
.Retrieve Top-K Docs from Library:
[source, python]
----
# `top_k` parameter optional
conn.ai.retrieveDocs("How many papers are there?", top_k = 5)
----
+
.Run a natural language query:
[source, python]
----
print(conn.ai.query("How many papers are there?"))

# prints: {'natural_language_response': 'There are 736389 papers.', 'answered_question': True, 'query_sources': {'function_call': "getVertexCount('Paper')", 'result': 736389}}
----
+
.Register a custom query:
[source, python]
----
# Prompt for PageRank query - could be read in as JSON file.
pr_prompt = {
    "function_header": "tg_pagerank",
    "description": "Determines the importance or influence of each vertex based on its connections to other vertices.",
    "docstring": "The PageRank algorithm measures the influence of each vertex on every other vertex. PageRank influence is defined recursively: a vertex’s influence is based on the influence of the vertices which refer to it. A vertex’s influence tends to increase if either of these conditions are met:\n* It has more referring vertices\n* Its referring vertices have higher influence\nTo run this algorithm, use `runInstalledQuery('tg_pagerank', params={'v_type': 'INSERT_V_TYPE_HERE', 'e_type': 'INSERT_E_TYPE_HERE', 'top_k': INSERT_TOP_K_HERE})`, where the parameters are:\n* 'v_type': The vertex type to run the algorithm on.\n* 'e_type': The edge type to run the algorithm on.\n* 'top_k': The number of top scoring vertices to return to the user.",
    "param_types": {
        "v_type": "str",
        "e_type": "str",
        "top_k": "int"
    }
}
----
+
.Register Query:
[source, python]
----
conn.ai.registerCustomQuery(pr_prompt["function_header"], pr_prompt["description"], pr_prompt["docstring"], pr_prompt["param_types"])
----
+
3. Once registered, you can now run the query.
+
.Run Query:
+

[source, python]
----
print(conn.ai.query("What are the 5 most influential papers by citations?"))

# prints: {'natural_language_response': 'The top 5 most cited papers are:\n\n1. [Title of paper with Vertex_ID 428523]\n2. [Title of paper with Vertex_ID 384889]\n3. [Title of paper with Vertex_ID 377502]\n4. [Title of paper with Vertex_ID 61855]\n5. [Title of paper with Vertex_ID 416200]', 'answered_question': True, 'query_sources': {'function_call': "runInstalledQuery('tg_pagerank', params={'v_type': 'Paper', 'e_type': 'CITES', 'top_k': 5})", 'result': [{'@@top_scores_heap': [{'Vertex_ID': '428523', 'score': 392.8731}, {'Vertex_ID': '384889', 'score': 251.8021}, {'Vertex_ID': '377502', 'score': 149.1018}, {'Vertex_ID': '61855', 'score': 129.7406}, {'Vertex_ID': '416200', 'score': 129.2286}]}]}}
