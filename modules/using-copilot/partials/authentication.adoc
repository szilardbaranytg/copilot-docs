== Authentication

There are two options to authenticate with the TigerGraph Co-Pilot service.


* First way is with a `username/password` pair generated from the TigerGraph database.

* The second way is a GSQL secret, also obtained from the database.

However, when using the GSQL secret, the username field must be specified as `____GSQL____secret`, with the password field containing the secret.

[NOTE]
====
If xref:1.6@pytigergraph:intro:index.adoc[] is being used and a connection is created with the `gsqlSecret` parameter, this will already be done for you.
