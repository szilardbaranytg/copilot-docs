== Authentication

There are two options to authenticate with the TigerGraph Co-Pilot service.


* The first way is with a `username/password` pair generated from the TigerGraph database.

* The second way is a GSQL secret, also obtained from the database.
When using the GSQL secret, the username field must be specified as `____GSQL____secret`, with the password field containing the secret.
However, if xref:pytigergraph:intro:index.adoc[pyTigerGraph v1.6+] is being used and a connection is created with the `gsqlSecret` parameter, then you don't need to provide a username and password.
