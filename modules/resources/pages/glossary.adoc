¦ Item ¦ Description

¦ RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
¦ RAG is a hybrid approach that combines a retrieval system with a generative model.
It retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base which is then used by a transformer-based model to generate responses.

¦ LLM (Large Language Model)
¦ Large Language Models are types of artificial intelligence models trained on vast amounts of text data.
They are capable of understanding and generating human-like text, and are used for tasks such as translation, summarization, and conversation.

¦ LLM Provider
¦ An LLM provider refers to a company or organization that offers Large Language Models (LLMs) as a service.

¦ LLM Provider API Key
¦ The API key verifies the identity of the requester, ensuring that the request is coming from a registered and authorized user or application.

¦ Self-Managed
¦ Refers to a software or platform that is hosted and managed by the user's own team, rather than being provided as a service by a third party.
It involves handling the setup, maintenance, and management of the software.


¦ Service Account
¦ A service account is a non-human user account used by applications and services to interact with software APIs or other tools.
It provides a way to grant access to resources programmatically, without using individual user credentials.

¦ PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
¦ PII refers to any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.
Examples include names, addresses, email addresses, and social security numbers.

¦ LangChain
¦ LangChain is a library that allows developers to integrate language models into applications.
It provides tools for building applications that combine language understanding and generation capabilities.

¦ Swagger
¦ Swagger (now known as OpenAPI) is a set of tools for building, documenting, and consuming REST APIs.
It helps standardize the process of API integration and documentation.

¦ Python
¦ Python programming language, known for its simplicity and versatility, used widely in data science, web development, automation, and many other areas of software development.


¦ Weights and Biases
¦ Weights and Biases is a machine learning platform that helps track experiments, visualize data, and automate model optimization.
It is widely used for tracking and visualizing the training of models.

¦ Test Suite
¦ A test suite in software development is a collection of test cases intended to verify that a software system meets its design specifications and behaves as expected.

¦ Docker
¦ Docker is a platform that uses containerization technology to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
